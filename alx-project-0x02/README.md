# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

This repository contains the initial setup for a Next.js project configured with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.  
Its purpose is to introduce foundational concepts such as project scaffolding, folder structure, component organization, and basic routing.  
This setup will serve as the starting point for building a fully functional modern web application as part of the ALX “SoloForge: Mastering Project Autonomy” project.
